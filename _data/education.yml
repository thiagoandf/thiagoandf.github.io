    During my time at ESPM I was able to learn and improve a several of my soft skills such as communication and teamwork. Because of the several group projects and initiatives I was part of, I became a more outgoing and less shy person. 
    At the sime time, I ended up falling in love with development and design, starting my carreer as a full-stack developer.

    One of the greatest honors I had while studying there was to be summoned to participate in the ICPC ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. Our performance in the first stage allowed us to go to the Latin America finals. This was the first time any group from my course as well as my College was classified for the finals.
