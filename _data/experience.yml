    This is the longest period of my carreer in the same role. I learned a lot while in this role since I was basically managing myself.
    
    Here are a few of the things I built/started in this time:
     • Worked alongside the designers to build from the ground up most of the company's platform using <mark>React</mark>, <mark>Redux</mark> and <mark>Javascript</mark>. 
     • Created couple of small RESTful APIs using Python that perform small tasks such as the creation of new users in the platform;
     • Added integrations with error reporting tools such as <mark>LogRocket</mark>. This enabled us to reduce the number of errors our clients faced in almost 70%. 
     • Led the development of the company's digital signature platform. This project was our first production-ready product and brought a lot of attention to the company inicially. We still receive almost 5k users every month with almost half a billion documents signed.
     • Automated the front-end deployment using Gitlab's CI/CD pipelines using <mark>Docker</mark> as well as organizing our Git Flow. 
     • Led the effort to implement code-reviews and linting of the code company-wide. All our code is now formatted according to the rules we defined back then and all our deploys are automated.
     • Recognized as being the company's top developer of the first semester of 2019.
